# Make Love To Your Plushies
## Instructions to Make a Strategically Placed Hole (SPH)

## Introduction
If you are reading this chances are you love your plushie(s). Maybe you kiss and cuddle them but you want to go further.

You want to have sex with a plushie.

This tutorial will help you with that. It describes how you can modify an existing plushie to have a very simple yet versatile strategically placed hole (SPH) which will allow you to penetrate your beloved plushie friend. Technically you could just cut a hole and go at it but in my opinion a proper SPH looks and feels way better - among other advantages. The SPH presented here feels best with denser, slightly more right plushies but works for others, too. The single layer design makes it easy, quick to sew and allows for it to be installed in plushies of a small minimum size. Depending on what you already have available the cost for materials and tools will be around 10 € to 40 € (11.84 \$ to 47.32 \$) to get enough stuff to make a *whole lot* of SPHs. Time is the limiting factor here. An absolute beginner will take about 4 to 6 hours to complete one SPH.

You might be familiar with the ancient tutorial by Mryia (https://www.tigress.com/mryia/howto/how-to.htm). While it shows an interesting SPH design and gives some basic understanding of what to do I always felt like it could be more detailed especially about the sewing. Additionally the shown SPH is not the simplest design which might avert newcomers. There is a different, very brief tutorial by fasterfind (https://www.reddit.com/r/Plushophile/comments/4j8c8y/new_to_the_whole_idea_hello_also_sph_question/; in the comments). The SPH design utilizes a zipper for direct access to the stuffing and allows for inserting a penetrable toy.

The following tutorial is supposed to be very detailed even with seemingly trivial tasks because if you are like me back then you might *not know shit* about sewing and actually *need the explanation*.

I am no expert in any of this so there are probably better ways of doing things but the described methods work and have a very low skill requirement. Remember, this is just *one way* of making an SPH. If you have a good idea feel free to deviate from this guide wherever you see fit. Even if you decide to create something completely different, you might still benefit from this tutorial as a beginner.

I hope you have fun and will feel proud of your finished craft. So let's get started!

## 1 What You Need
* **Plushie**
  * Large enough to fit the insert
    * It needs space of a cylindrical area with a diameter of about 8 cm (3.15 in) and a length of about 20 cm (7.87 in).
    * Larger plushies will work, smaller ones might/might not.
* **Fabric for the insert**
  * Satin
    * Great for very dense/tight plushies
    * *Cannot be penetrated* on smaller plushies without a cloth penis sleeve, though!
  * Other fabrics (e.g. fleece or plush fur) can be used instead, if you want.
  * Color of your choice
    * Bright pink is always a good option.
    * Use the same color as your plushie for a more subtle look.
* **Thread**
  * Should match the color of the insert for the cleanest look
  * "Cheap" thread is said to be less durable and more difficult to handle
  * Spools of "high quality" thread are not that expensive really
* **Additional thread** (semi-optional)
  * Should match the color of your plushie
  * You don't always need this but depending where and how you make the hole in your plushie you will need to sew parts of it back together.
* **Stuffing** (semi-optional)
  * Polyfill ("Polyester-Fiberfill") can be used to make your plushie denser and therefore the SPH tighter.
  * Some plushies have small bean bags in them that would get in the way of the SPH. Remove those and use polyfill to fill up the empty space.
* **Sewing kit**
  * Small sewing needle
  * Pin needles
  * Measuring tape or ruler
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sharp</span> scissors (hair scissors work great for satin)
  * Seam ripper
  * Threading aid (optional)
  * Thimble (optional)
  * Clothespins (optional, you can use pin needles instead)
* **Lighter**
  * To melt the edges the satin
* **Smooth, long right object**
  * Used to push the SPH insert into the plushie
  * Needs low friction against the fabric of the insert
  * The handle of a hair brush or a medium sized dildo might work.
  * Not your XL Bad Dragon toys, you size queen!
* **Cloth penis sleeve** (recommended for use)
  * To reduce friction during penetration
  * Required with tighter satin inserts
* **Dry condoms** (recommended for use)
  * Nut while being balls-deep inside your plushie without any mess to clean up!
  * Buy in bulk (50 - 100 pieces) to get a low price.
  * Check out different brands. Some smell very little of latex, others more.
* **4 to 6 hours of your time**
  * This highly depends on your level of experience and skills.
  * If you can use a sewing machine for the insert you might be way faster.
  * I'm very slow with stuff like this in so you might be faster anyway.

## 2 Sewing the Insert
### 2.1 Measure, mark then cut a rectangular piece of the fabric
* Be aware of the orientation of the fabric
  * Satin has a smooth and a rough side.
  * The smooth side also has a smooth and a rough orientation.
  * The long edge should be parallel to the smooth orientation.
* 18 cm (7.09 in) wide and 26 cm (10.24 in) long should be fine for most penises.
  * The width is about 3 cm (1.18 in) + the circumference of your erect penis at the widest spot.
  * The length should be at least 10 cm (3.34 in) + the length of your erect penis.
    * Too long is generally better than too short.
    * Unless you rather bottom out than go balls deep.
* I have trouble cutting satin with regular household scissors but a pair of hair scissors works great.

### 2.2 Use the lighter to melt the edges of the satin.
* Skip this step if you are not using satin.
* Melting the edges will prevent the individual fibers of the satin from slipping off the mesh.
* This might be a bit tricky. Try not to burn yourself, the fabric or anything else!
* The outmost threads of the fabric will melt together preventing them from just slipping off the material.
* Don't overdo it. The edges will get a bit wrinkly but you don't want to warp everything.
* Pull the edges a bit to get rid of most wrinkles. It's normal that parts of the welded edges rip up again. Most of the edges will stay welded.

### 2.3 Fold the fabric into the shape of the insert.
* Spread out the fabric with the smooth side downwards.
* Fold one of the short edges upwards onto the fabric to create a flap. The flap should be 5 cm (1.97 in) wide. This is the front end of the insert.
* Flip it upside down so the smooth side is facing up now.
* Fold the fabric in half - parallel to the long edges.
* Use either clothespins or pin needles to make the insert stay folded.

### 2.4 Sew the insert.
* There is a detailed description of the very basics of sewing in the Sewing Tips section.
* The diagonal Basting Stitch should work for this.
* Start at the tip at the front.
* Only the very first stitch should go through all four layers.
  * This will keep the flap in place.
  * Don't sew it onto anything anywhere else.
* Sew along the long edge and along the short edge on the back end of the insert.
* Yes, hand sewing can be tedious. But you *want* to fuck your plushie, right?

## Sewing Tips
Before making my very first SPH I had never sewn anything in my life. In case you have the same level of experience I had back then I will cover the basics you need for this craft. I wish I had had this for my first attempts at sewing.

### Threading a Needle
* Cut off a piece of thread from the spool
  * A little bit less than twice the distance between your hands when you spread your arms - any longer will be difficult to handle.
  * This is also about as much thread as you need for the insert itself. In case you need more just finish the seam where you are and start a new seam with new thread where you left off.
* Fold the thread in half to double it up.
  * Doubling the thread gives the seam more strength/durability and enables a good threading technique.
* Make a knot at the open end to tie the loose threads together.
  * This is the back end of the double thread.
  * I usually use two regular knots on top of each other.
  * Don't make the loose ends too short.
* Push the wire loop of the threading aid through the eye of your sewing needle.
* Push the front end of the double thread through the wire loop and pull it through the eye using the threading aid.
* If you don't have a threading aid you have to push the thread through the needle directly. Pull the loop on the front end of the thread over the tip of the needle and pull it tight.
* The needle is now hooked onto the thread.
  * Doing it this way allows you to unhook and rehook the needle.
  * This is helpful if you pushed the needle through the material in the wrong spot and cannot pull it back.
